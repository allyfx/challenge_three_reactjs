- You can use the `Adicionar` button to update your front end with the back end, it'll update the list of repositories with the back end.

- You can use the `Remover` button to remove the repository from the list and the back end.

- To add a new repository in the back end you'll have to use the Insomnia software and follow the rules for using the back end, you can find these rules in the [back end repository.](https://github.com/allyfx/challenge_two_node)
